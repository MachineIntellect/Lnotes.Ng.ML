# What is Machine Learning? 2 Definitions & 2 Examples
## quick recap
    The definition of ML from Tom Mitchell
    E: experience
    T: task
    P: performance measure

## 2 Definitions
Two definitions of Machine Learning are offered. Arthur Samuel described it as: "the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." This is an older, informal definition.

Tom Mitchell provides a more modern definition: "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."

## Example_1: playing checkers.

E = the experience of playing many games of checkers

T = the task of playing checkers.

P = the probability that the program will win the next game.

In general, any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications:

Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning.

## Example_2: email spam filters.

E = Watching you label emails as spam or not spam.

T = Classify emails as spam or not spam.

P = The number (or fraction) of emails correctly classified as spam/not spam.
